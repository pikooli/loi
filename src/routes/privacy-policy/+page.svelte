	<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
	<p>
		We do not actively collect or store any personal data on our website. The only personal

	<h2>2. How We Use the Information</h2>
	<p>
		The email addresses and names you provide during the LOI creation process are used exclusively
		to send the signed LOI via email to all signatories, including the project creator. We do not
		store, share, or otherwise retain any of this information after the LOI has been sent.
	</p>

	<h2>3. Data Retention</h2>
	<p>
		We do not retain any personal information after the LOI has been sent. All email addresses,
		names, and related information are discarded immediately after the email is sent.
	</p>

	<h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
	<p>
		We may use third-party services to send the emails containing the signed LOIs. These services
		are required to comply with applicable data protection laws. However, we do not share your
		information with any other third parties beyond this specific use case.
	</p>
